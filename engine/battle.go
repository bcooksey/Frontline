/* A Battle involes attacking units and defending uints.
* It consists of rounds, where each round has several phases:
    1. Submarine surprise strike or submerge (sea battles only)
      * Attacking subs roll or submerge
      * Defending subs roll or submerge
      * Defender must select who will die
      * Attacker must select who will die
      * Units die!
    2. Attacking units fire
    3. Defending units fire
    4. Remove defenderâ€™s casualties
      * Defender must select who will die
      * Attacker must select who will die
      * Units die!
* After the final phase, one of four things happens:
  1: The attacker decides to attack again - A new round begins
  1: The attacker kills all the defending units - Results in capturing Zone. Battle is over
  2: The attacker withdrawls - Must relocate units back to a friendly Zone. Battle is over
  3: The defender kills all the attackers units - Battle is over
